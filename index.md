ðŸ‘‹ Welcome! I'm a cybersecurity professional with expertise in threat detection, incident response, and digital forensics. With hands-on experience in EDR investigations, malware analysis, and network forensics, I specialize in identifying and mitigating security threats.

Iâ€™ve worked with Elastic, Hayabusa, Velociraptor, SentinelOne, CrowdStrike, Suricata, and Wireshark to analyze attacks, detect anomalies, and improve security postures. My passion lies in uncovering cyber threats, investigating breaches, and strengthening defenses against evolving threats.

This blog will have multiple projects built and displayed here:
- Malware Reverse Engineering
- Pentesting Boxes
- Research
  
Iâ€™m always open to new opportunities!
