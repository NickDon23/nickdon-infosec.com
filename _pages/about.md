With a strong background in cybersecurity, cloud security, and threat detection, I specialize in incident response, malware analysis, and Red Team operations. My experience spans Azure, AWS, and on-prem environments, where I've helped organizations strengthen their security posture, detect advanced threats, and remediate cyber incidents.

Throughout my career, I’ve worked with leading security tools like CrowdStrike Falcon, SentinelOne, Elastic, Velociraptor, Hayabusa, Suricata, and Wireshark to investigate ransomware, data exfiltration, and IT misconfigurations. My expertise extends to reverse engineering malware, penetration testing, and cloud security compliance (DoD STIGs, NIST, ISO 27001/27002, ITAR).

I thrive in fast-paced environments, managing high-priority security incidents, building custom detection rules, and securing enterprise networks. With a passion for continuous learning, I hold certifications including CISSP, CySA+, and multiple CrowdStrike certifications, and have participated in OSINT investigations to support real-world missing persons cases.

Whether it's defending against cyber threats, optimizing security operations, or engaging in adversary simulation, I’m always eager to tackle new challenges.
